Imagine asking, “Who was the captain of the Titanic?” and your AI goes:“

Sure, let me solve this Sudoku and a Markov Decision Process first.”

Ridiculous, right? 

But that’s exactly what’s happening with OVERTHINK attacks on reasoning-based LLMs. 

Here’s the scam:

➡️ Hackers inject hidden tasks like puzzles or advanced equations into prompts.

➡️ The AI wastes expensive tokens solving irrelevant problems.

➡️ You get a normal answer while your API bill skyrockets and response time crawls.

The worst part? 

It’s invisible to users but painfully visible on your wallet.💬
