I remember proposing something to my VP Marketing, back when I was a head of sales:

"When we're reporting CAC Payback to the CEO, why don't we split it out between SDR and marketing? That way we can see how each department is performing individually."

She was polite. But I knew I messed up.

"Alex. I really don't think that's a good idea."

I immediately realized the problem: #Marketing and #Sales need to work TOGETHER. And SHOW that they're working together.

Let's say a lead fills out a contact form on the website after receiving a well-written email from an SDR a few days earlier.

Who "sourced" that lead? Is that a fair question?

The investment that marketing made into producing great content on your site, on LinkedIn, on Quora, etc: do you think that has an effect on whether someone is warmer or colder, when you call them unexpectedly?

Do you think your BRAND has anything to do with how easy of a time your SDR team is going to have?

Get out of your spreadsheet.

Calm your ego. Work as a team.

Shoot for the bigger goal.
