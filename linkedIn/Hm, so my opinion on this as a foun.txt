Hm, so my opinion on this as a founder is very different ;-) 

Founders should figure out the type of company they want to build first. 

Then they should focus on customers and nothing else. 

Whether they need funding or not is a function of how big the customers are and how quickly they can get them to pay for something ;) 

Listen to early signals and validate the problem within the solution space. 

Making money > raising money. 

Money is the ultimate validator of any idea.

Funding is like steroids: quite addictive and can potentially kill you.

And Funding can be a major distraction.

I know so many founders who get stuck in their funding cadence that their products suffer from it. 

They end up building for 4 years, raising money, and getting to a 50M valuation if they're lucky. 

But then can't sell because the Liq. preferences would leave them out of the money.

Sounds like a terrible deal. 

Founders should focus on customers. 

Customers will attract investors. 

If you raise, do it on your terms. 

As the cost of technology goes down to 0, we will need less funding for building. 

And as our attention spans go down to 0, we will need more money for marketing ;)
