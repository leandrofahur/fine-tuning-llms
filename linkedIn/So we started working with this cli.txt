So we started working with this client back in January of last year.

It looks almost too perfect to be true.

"What, you started your engagement in Jan 2020 and THAT'S when they started climbing exponentially for new keywords and value of the organic traffic they're bringing in?"

Yep.

I'll post an anonymized link in the comments to a screenshot of when the signed MSA was uploaded to our Google Drive.

Cause, y'know, proof.

Here's what their wonderful, over-worked and under-appreciated marketing director said today, when I asked them how results were coming along:

"Well the website is up, leads are up, everything is.... up. Traffic up by 123%; 16% in the last month alone. And last month was the highest ever for traffic, a record for the 3rd month in a row. Non-branded keyword clicks up 288% y/y."

I actually don't think we even... did a whole lot. They did most of it.

They improved the quality of their service enormously, they put out some great content, and they worked tirelessly.

And yes, we had some deliverables of course. We helped earn links, built content, guided social strategy.

But that's all we can do: be the bumpers on their bowling alley.

We can help you shoot fewer gutterballs.

Thus, you shoot way more strikes.

Stop trying to do marketing the hard way.
