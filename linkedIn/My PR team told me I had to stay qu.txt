My PR team* told me I had to stay quiet, but now I can finally share the news...

Open Campus is BACK for 2024, and bigger than ever! 🎉

Mark your calendars for October 21-31st, because we're making the entire Maven Analytics platform 100% FREE for everyone.

Will we regret it? Maybe 🤷‍♂️

But there's no turning back now, so why not go big!?

Here's what you'll get:

💡 UNLIMITED LEARNING

Anyone with a Free account will get access to all Pro features, including courses, learning paths, guided projects, portfolios, assessments and credentials.

🎙️ LIVE EVENTS & WORKSHOPS

During Open Campus we'll be hosting 25 (!) live interviews and expert-led workshops, covering technical skills, career advice, AI trends and more.

You'll hear from Kate Strachnyi, Ian K., Annie Nelson, Christopher Chin, Albert Bellamy, Marjolein Opsteegh, Sonali Kumar and more – and of course your favorite Maven instructors :)

🏆 AWARDS & PRIZES

Compete to be named a Portfolio Powerhouse, Learning Legend or Open Campus MVP and win prizes like Maven swag and even lifetime platform access.

If you've been on the fence about checking out the Maven platform, this is your best opportunity to see what we're all about!
