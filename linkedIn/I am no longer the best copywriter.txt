I am no longer the best copywriter or marketer on my team.

Nor the best salesperson or account manager.

There is someone on the team better than me at anything you can think of.

So the question that kept me up at night for a while as I went from consultant to leader is: what is my value as our CEO then?

I think it's this:

I need to read between the lines to see patterns nobody else does. My job is to predict the future before it's here.

To support my leadership team in reacting to the present in a healthy way that helps us build that future.

I learn new skills and teach them to my team. I pilot new technologies, strategies, and business lines.

My personal growth must equal or exceed the pace of our company's growth.

I am glue.

I need to be the Olympic torch of the team, whose main job is just to never let the fire go out.

Not sure. What did I miss?
