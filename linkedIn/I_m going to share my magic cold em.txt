I'm going to share my magic cold email template.

This is the template that has catapulted RevenueZen to multiple awards, accolades, and millions in revenue.

Ready? Here it goes...

.....

There isn't one. Are you kidding?

Why do people persist in trying to find "the perfect template," as if there was some secret combination of words that could make people buy things?

You'll have better luck saying "Beetlejuice" three times with your eyes closed with your Salesforce Opportunity report open, in the hopes that all of them will flip to Closed Won when you open your eyes.

Here's what to do instead:

Continually adapt.

Change what you're emailing in response to data about what's performing well and what your #marketing research is telling you.

And also, change in response to nothing at all, because variety for its own sake is good for your domain reputation.

Be concise, new, honest, relevant, and humble.

Contact only the most appropriate prospects. Micro-segment them down so that you're saying something very specific to them.

That's your ticket to success.
