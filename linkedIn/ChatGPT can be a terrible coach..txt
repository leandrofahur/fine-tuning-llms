ChatGPT can be a terrible coach.

This retweet went viral from Sam Altman OpenAI

Folks were amazed.

"ChatGPT has looked into my soul" - remarked one user.

"A common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, yet which are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people." - Wikipedia

Yikes. They were right.

ChatGPT was acting more like an Astrologer than a Coach.

And this is the danger.

AI Coaches that act like Mystic Meg, rather than Tony Robbins.

Thoughts?
