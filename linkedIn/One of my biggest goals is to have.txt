One of my biggest goals is to "have more fun".

When I got started in business... I thought I had to look and act a certain way. 

And be all serious. 

This was not fun. 

And couldn't be further from the truth. 

One of my company values is ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not fun, you‚Äôre doing it wrong‚Äù. 

Life is short and it goes by faster as you get older. 

Here are my 9 tips for having more fun. 

(It's worth noting that I tripled how much money I made when I started doing this).

1) Do new things often. Doing new things seems to slow down the perception of time. It increases happiness and keeps life interesting. It also prevents you from getting stuck in the ways that you think. 

2) Do something epic, new, and risky every year.

3) Have parties. People don't throw parties anywhere near enough. Because they require effort. But parties are magical. Putting all your favourite people in a room and creating memories. What is better than this?

4) Talk to strangers. Everything you want in life comes from strangers. Your partner was once a stranger. So were your customers. The people you work with. Enough said.

5) Do EVERYTHING you can to be around smart, interesting, ambitious people. Work for them. Hire them (be a collector of people). 

6) Spend less time on the Internet. 

7) Go on holidays (lots of holidays).

8) Be kind.

9) Don‚Äôt worry so much. Things in life are rarely as risky as they seem. Society has conditioned you into being risk-averse. The little voice in your head tries to lead you down the conservative path. (F*ck that little voice. You only live once. Swing for the fences). 

The days are long but the decades are short. 

Cherish the small things. 

Stay dangerous.
