Lying to yourself is the biggest Go To Market mistake that I see.

A bunch of people in a room who know a good amount about their industry and value proposition, saying stuff like:

"We don't really have strong competition" (yes you do, go look for it)
"Nobody's going to be able to resist this value prop" (oh I'm sure they will, have you tried yet?)
"Really everyone is an ideal buyer for this, regardless of industry" (maybe eventually, when you're Salesforce or Oracle? not when you're 4 guys in a garage)
...and so on.

By the way, I have nothing against 4 people in a garage. Our clients are everything from 1 person, to 400 person companies.

It's not the size of the company that matters, it's the level of self-honesty.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to only believe information that fits our world view. Avoid this by acknowledging that you have an active ego, which - if unchecked - threatens your company's success.

You don't need to know everything to be a great founder, or a great leader.
